Computer animation is a general term for a kind of visual digital display technology that simulates moving objects on-screen.
Modern forms of computer animation evolved from more primitive computer graphics over the last few decades, as huge advances in computer technology led to much more sophisticated imaging methods
Modern computer animation can achieve dazzling results with three-dimensional figures acting against a three-dimensional background.
As a result, it has largely revolutionized the film industry by reducing the costs associated with setting up physical film sets, hiring extras and gathering props. 

My Animation is A Birthday invite video . Instead of usually sending invitations of your child through printed letters . 
You can make a video and sent it to people who live far away from you.
Also, the video is an interesting way to invite your relatives on your child's first birthday !
